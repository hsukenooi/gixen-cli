"""Plugin entry-point system for gixen-cli.

External packages register against the ``gixen.plugins`` entry-point group.
At FastAPI startup, the loader (``load_plugins``) discovers installed
plugins and registers them with a ``pluggy.PluginManager``. The host then
invokes three hooks during the lifespan:

    register_db_tables(conn)        — plugin creates its own SQLite tables
    register_routes(app)            — plugin mounts FastAPI routes on the app
    register_dashboard_tabs() -> list[dict]
                                    — plugin returns dashboard tab specs

Plugin authors import the ``hookimpl`` marker from this module to decorate
their hook implementations::

    from gixen.plugins import hookimpl

    @hookimpl
    def register_routes(app):
        app.include_router(...)

    A plugin does not have to implement all three hooks — pluggy will only

    (alphabetical) unless a plugin uses ``@hookimpl(tryfirst=True)`` or
    ``trylast=True`` to override.

    Error handling: per-plugin isolation is applied at hook-invocation time
    by the host's lifespan. A plugin whose hook raises will not prevent
    other plugins from registering (for ``register_db_tables`` — see
    ``load_plugins`` and the lifespan in ``server/main.py``).

            Tables must be namespaced (e.g. ``comic_fmv``, not ``fmv``) to
            avoid collisions with the core ``bids`` table or other plugins.

        DDL executed in this hook is wrapped in a SQLite savepoint by the
        host; a failure rolls back this plugin's DDL only.

        ``app.state.db`` is guaranteed to be set to the same connection by the
        host before this hook fires. Plugins can read it via the FastAPI
        request lifecycle later (e.g. ``request.app.state.db``).

        **Important:** call ``conn.execute(...)`` per statement, NOT
        ``conn.executescript(...)``. Python's sqlite3 ``executescript``
        implicitly commits any pending transaction before running, which
        releases the host's savepoint and breaks per-plugin isolation. If
        you need multiple statements, call ``conn.execute`` for each one.

        ``label`` — display text shown in the nav (e.g. ``"Comics"``).
        ``path``  — href for the nav link (e.g. ``"/v2/comics"``).

        The host collects all plugin tab lists, flattens them, stores the
        result on ``app.state.dashboard_tabs``, and exposes it via
        ``GET /api/dashboard-tabs``. The dashboard JS fetches that endpoint
